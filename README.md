# wearable-first-design
Presentation for wearable first design

This presentation was created for an accessibility design meetup. This is the first time I've used Github for a keynote file, but it seems like a logical extension to Slideshare and converting to HTML. For future reference, here are the published versions. 
* Slideshare: http://www.slideshare.net/7mary4/wearablefirst-design-and-accessibility
* Accessible HTML Version Wearability.org - http://wearability.org/wearable-first-design.html
